### Interact-js & React-rnd
In order to create draggable and resizable 'pin'/image React components, I chose to use [Interact-js](http://interactjs.io/). However, React was clashing with Interact-js — I could only drag a pin/image or resize it, not both — so I then found [React-rnd](https://github.com/bokuweb/react-rnd), an Interact-js 'wrapper' designed for use with React.
